This is a second part of the series on ISC Delft's history. Please <a href="https://www.iscdelft.nl/blog/2019-08-19-history-isc-delft/">click here</a> to go to the start of the series.



<strong><em>In 1988, the services moved to Raamstraat. Why did you leave Oude Delft? </em></strong>

<blockquote>In 1988, remember we were holding services in the club of a Fraternity, we were commanded to leave our beloved Oude Delft 18, due to misbehavior throughout the week by Dutch students using the building. The neighbors were tired of their behavior in this prestigious environment. Sanctus Virgilius felt guilty and offered us the alternative of another Oude Delft owned property nr.57, the former Saint Barbara Monastery, be it in the loft. It was a sad, but thank God short lived phase for ISC. Father Piet had convinced his Franciscan colleges in Raamstraat of the need of a steady shelter for foreign students on Sundays, the Franciscans understood and ISC moved to its current location, the magic chapel of Raamstraat 78.</blockquote>

<strong><em>Was finding a new location the hardest challenge that ISC has faced as a student church? (if not, what is the hardest moment?)</em></strong>

<blockquote>Students came, professionals left. The majority of the students obtained their much worked for academic degree. So it was with the clergy which served, lectured and lead this incredible young global group of faithful [see also the time line). The formula of bi-monthly remained till 1999. At the brink of the new millennium Father Ben Engelbertink &amp; Rev. Waltraut Stroh concluded the services should and would be weekly. It increased the availability and the traditional rhythm for churchgoing, a most effective decision. Numbers of students rose dramatically, also caused by increasing numbers of International Students in TUDelft, as it had started Master and PhD courses in English. Slowly IHE worshipper supply dominance lowered to almost equal balances. The TUDelft students with us are mainly European, Indian, Chinese and Latino. Hats off to these two clergy for this moment of thought.</blockquote>

<strong><em>Students come and go. Priests retire and new ones come. In many other Dutch cities the International Student Chaplaincies did not survive, but ISC Delft is still going strong. What makes ISC Delft so successful? </em></strong>

<blockquote>The success of ISC Delft is a triple; 1. It build a stamina through three decades of withstanding continues change. 2. A mouth to mouth advertising by former students. 3. The bounding exemplary bonding of the choir members.  And allow me 4. God’s smile of what He saw for all these years.



Thank you Lord for the blessing called ISC Delft. We have been abundant blessed with Masters and Doctors, with weddings and baptisms, all of the greater moments in life.</blockquote>
