testimony: >-
  I met the ISC community by chance 4 years ago when I participated in an
  interfaith religion activity to which ISC contributed for the organization. I
  enjoyed the ecumenical spirit lived by different people of around the world.
  Since then, I've made strong friendships and I became even more active in the
  community by being a member of the committee where I help with the
  organization of activities.
