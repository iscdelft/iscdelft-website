  I arrived in Delft around 5 years ago. I found ISC Delft because I was looking
  for a Sunday service in English, and I immediately loved the welcoming
  atmosphere and the songs in several languages. As time passed, I started
  appreciating the ecumenism and the dialogue with people of different countries
  and traditions. I found there friends and even my wife, and ISC is now an
  important part of my life.
