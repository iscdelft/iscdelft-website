  For me, ISC Delft is a constant reminder of great people who helped me build a
  home in a foreign land, learning new songs in so many different languages,
  enjoying lovely home cooked meals from virtually all the continents, and more
  importantly constantly rediscovering myself in the company of brothers and
  sisters.
